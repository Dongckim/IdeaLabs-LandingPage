### AR Era is Coming.
The launch of AR Glass by Mark Zuckerberg has significantly amplified global interest and highlighted the immense potential of 3D and AR devices. AR technology seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, enabling immersive and interactive experiences that have transformative applications across industries such as education, healthcare, and retail. Recognizing this potential, we initiated this project to pioneer user-centric innovations that deliver meaningful value and redefine how people engage with technology.

### Ready For AR Industry.
We define next-generation AR as the convergence of advanced technologies, including tracking, dynamic 3D reconstruction, registration, rendering, and physics simulation, to deliver immersive and interactive experiences. Among the various techniques for rendering and dynamic 3D reconstruction, We have chosen to focus on Three.js as a starting point, using it as the foundation for my project development and to deepen my understanding of these core concepts.


## AS-IS
As someone interested in creating interactive 2D/3D web content, we have struggled to find resources that effectively teach both front-end development and 3D web graphics. While there are plenty of courses on game development and Unity, there is a noticeable lack of accessible and comprehensive materials focused on web-based 3D technologies. This has made it **challenging to bridge the gap between the knowledge of web development** and **the advanced skills needed to build dynamic 3D websites.**

## TO-BE
To address this, we are now learning R3F (React Three Fiber), a powerful stack that combines React and Three.js, allowing me to create 3D web content with ease and efficiency. This unique learning approach not only simplifies the process but also makes it engaging and practical. During this break, we are applying these skills to develop a **3D Web E-Commerce Project**, which will help me solidify my understanding and produce an innovative, interactive web experience.
